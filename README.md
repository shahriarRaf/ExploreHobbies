# ExploreHobbies
This code represents a program that allows users to explore various hobbies, specifically reading newspapers, watching documentaries, reading research papers, and accessing blogs and art. The program is implemented using object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes.

Here's a summary of how the code works:

1. The program defines an abstract base class called `Hobby`, which contains a pure virtual function `display()`.

2. There are four derived classes: `Newspaper`, `Documentary`, `ResearchPaper`, and `BlogAndArt`, all of which inherit from the `Hobby` class and implement the `display()` function.

3. Each derived class provides specific options related to the corresponding hobby. For example, the `Newspaper` class allows users to select a newspaper and provides a link to the selected newspaper's website.

4. The `main()` function acts as the entry point of the program. It repeatedly presents a menu of options for the user to choose from.

5. Depending on the user's choice, the program dynamically allocates an object of the corresponding hobby class using polymorphism. The base class pointer `hobby` points to the created object.

6. The `display()` function of the selected hobby is invoked through the base class pointer, allowing the user to explore the selected hobby.

7. After the hobby exploration is complete, the dynamically allocated object is deleted, and the process repeats until the user chooses to exit the program.

Overall, this code provides a simple and interactive way for users to explore different hobbies by leveraging the principles of object-oriented programming.
